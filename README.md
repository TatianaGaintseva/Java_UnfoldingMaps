WHAT IT IS
---------------------------

This program starts Java Applet and shows the real-time map with some cities (specified in json file) and eartquakes on it. 
Descriptions of cities and quakes can be shown when hovering a mouse on it. Clicking a city will leave only those earthquakes 
on the map, which can harm this city, and clicking on the quake will leave only those cities on the map, which are affected by 
ths quake.
